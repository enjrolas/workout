This is a customizable timer for a workout routine.  In the data
folder, there is a file called 'workout.txt'  Use this file to list
the exercises in your routine, and the number of seconds to do each
exercise for.  The program will display a timer for each exercise, and
play a sound when each exercise is complete.  There is a seven-second
pause in between each exercise.  

For fun, the program will pull in images of the exercises based on
random google image search results.  It'll load a new image every five
seconds.  Based on my randomGoogleImage function from [here](https://raw.github.com/enjrolas/processingGlory/master/randomImageDisplay.pde)

The workout and timings that ship with the code are based on a
seven-minute workout app that my friend [Bilal](http://bilalghalib.com/) introduced me to.  I
wanted to tweak the workout and add my own exercises, so I made this
program.

To run the program, download the latest version of [Processing](http://processing.org).  Clone
the repo into its own directory, open the .pde file with
Processing, and click Run.  I didn't include an executable out of
reverence for all that is holy and good.

Enjoy!
